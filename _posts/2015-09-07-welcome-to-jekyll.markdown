Today I created blog using Jekyll, which I'll be using to document some stuff that's going on here in ATX.  This may or may not include: Front End Web Dev research and projects, house remodel projects and thoughts, outdoor pursuits, and an ongoing list of meals that I'd like my wife to cook for me.
